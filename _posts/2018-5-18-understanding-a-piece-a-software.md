title: Understanding a piece of software
---

A typical piece of software whether it be a library or an executable, a client or a server, a single executable or a collection of many ones, may have the following attributes.

- Input: 
  - config
  - input data

- Output: 
  - log
  - output data 

- Extension:
  - pulgin

Bigger piece of software is made up of smaller ones usually by embedding smaller ones among the logic of a bigger one. This process can happen recursively to build a very large piece of software. When human has to make realtime interactions with a software, the process may be implemented in two pieces of software leaving human to decide to continue or not possibly by a shell or a graphical user interface.
